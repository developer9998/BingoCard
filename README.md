To switch what element of the bingo menu you want to change, use the left and right arrow keys.  
When editing a task, you can type it out and press enter just like the title.   
Although if you press Option 1, it will change to a random task from a list of 130+ different tasks.  
To check a task off your list, just press it with your right index finger, and to uncheck a task press it again.
